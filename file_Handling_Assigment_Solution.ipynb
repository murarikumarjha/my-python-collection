    "The close() method of a file object flushes any unwritten information and closes the file object, after which no more writing can be done.\n",
    "its importance are as following : -\n",
    "(1) It is a matter of good programming practice. If you don't close them yourself, Python will eventually close them for you. In some versions of Python, that might be the instant they are no longer being used; in others, it might not happen for a long time. Under some circumstances, it might not happen at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) When writing to a file, the data may not be written to disk until the file is closed. When you say \"output.write(...)\", the data is often cached in memory and doesn't hit the hard drive until the file is closed. The longer you keep the file open, the greater the chance that you will lose data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Since your operating system has strict limits on how many file handles can be kept open at any one instant, it is best to get into the habit of closing them when they aren't needed and not wait for \"maid service\" to clean up after you.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Also, some operating systems (Windows, in particular) treat open files as locked and private. While you have a file open, no other program can also open it"
